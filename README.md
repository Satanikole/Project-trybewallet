# 💸Welcome to Trybe Wallet!

Trybe Wallet is a project I did at Trybe, which is a programing school. In order to test my knowledge of Redux, I also learned a lot by using Material UI to style it, but, unfortunately, I forgot the mobile first rule and this site is currently only available for desktop 😔
Newbie developer mistakes (╥_╥)

# Special Thanks

Since day one Trybe motto's is "if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together", and because of that I couldn't make this project better without the help and opinion of my fellow coleagues: 

⭐ [Kaylane Silva](https://github.com/KaylaneSilva) The goddess of Redux and css component positioning, thank you for the knowledge we shared.
<br>

⭐ [Gerson Henrique](https://github.com/gerson-henrique) An amazing friend that didn't think twice before helping me hunt for bugs in my code.
<br>

⭐ [Iago Medeiros](https://github.com/medeirosiago) Always encouraging everyone to push further and do better, it was a pleasure to code with you.
<br>

⭐ [Guilherme Leite](https://github.com/guilherme-leite) Your valuable input about design and style made me re-do my application design into something much more professional and appealing.
